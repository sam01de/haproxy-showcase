A) Quick introductory example to grab attention (~ 1-2 min)
	i) Startup 5 local servers with simple hello world applications in containers, start HAProxy in round robin and show how one server
	after the other is chosen
	ii) 2-3 Introductory Sentences about HAProxy

B) Recap Background (~ 1-2 mins)
   i) Proxy/Reverse Proxy
   ii) Load balancing
   
C) HAProxy (~ 5 mins)

   iii) Some Benchmark-Stats
   
   
D) Quick comparison: nginx vs HAProxy (~2 mins) - Practically Relevant for the audience, many probably use nginx
   i) Load Balancing Performance
   ii) Features
   
E) Showcase (~5 mins) - Extend on example in A), show config details, change something etc. All 5 local servers run in resource-restricted containers. Run "Locust" to show performance differences between a single server and load balanced server and playing around with the config a bit - e.g. hold connections for a random time by servers and compare "roundRobin" to "leastconn"

F) Show QR Code with which audience can download docker compose file to run the exemplary setup themsels if they want
